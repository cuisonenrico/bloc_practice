# BLoC Practice
This is a repository where I utilize BLoC in Flutter for state management. Utilizing GoRouter for navigation. This is mainly to practice and find out the use-case of BLoC as compared to other State Management libraries i.e. RiverPod, AsyncRedux

# Setup 
This project utilizes Flutter Version Management. Please have this installed and use Flutter Version 3.24.0

    > dart pub global activate fvm
    > 
    > fvm use 3.24.0
Also, do not forget to run the build_runner

    > flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs --verbose
    
A workflow is also included in the project that automatically creates a pull request when a commit is made on 'feature/**'. Afterwards, a workflow will check for lints.
